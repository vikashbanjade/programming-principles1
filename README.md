# Simple Python Games

This repository contains a collection of simple games implemented in Python using the built-in `tkinter` library. These games are designed to be easy to understand and serve as examples for beginners learning Python and game development.

## Games

1. **Bouncing Ball**: A simple game where a ball bounces around the window, and the player has no control over it. The goal is to observe the ball's movement and collision detection with the walls.

2. **Snake Game**: A classic Snake game where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The goal is to prevent the snake from colliding with the walls or its own body.

3. **Pong Game**: A basic implementation of the Pong game, where two paddles move vertically, and a ball bounces between them. The player controls one paddle, and the other paddle is controlled by the computer.

4. **Simple Paddle Game**: A game where the player controls a paddle horizontally using the mouse cursor. The goal is to keep a bouncing ball from hitting the bottom of the window by deflecting it with the paddle.

## Requirements

These games are written in Python and use the `tkinter` library, which is part of the Python standard library. No additional libraries or dependencies need to be installed.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the game you want to run.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in that directory.
4. Run the Python file corresponding to the game (e.g., `python bouncing_ball.py`).

## Customization

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to enhance the games or create your own variations. You can change the game logic, add new features, or adjust the visual elements to suit your preferences.
